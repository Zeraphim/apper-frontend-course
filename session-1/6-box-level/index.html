1. Find a website you like and create a block-level diagram for it using CSS and HTML. Remember, a block-level diagram
is a box-only view of a website. In class, we discussed how everything on a website can be represented as box, so this
should be a nice exercise in identifying layouts and thinking how the HTML and CSS for those will work out.

Create a folder called `6-box-level` in your repo and add the files there. Name your HTML file as **`index.html`** and
your CSS file as `styles.css`. Also add a screenshot called `box-level.png` (or whatever image format, e.g., HEIC, JPG)
as part of the submission so I have a higher level view of your work before running it.

If you want, you can opt to submit a CodePen or CodeSandbox link instead, just add it inside a file called
`box-level.txt` inside the `6-box-level` folder.
